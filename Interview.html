        <p><b>The business</b><br><br>Check out the company's website to get information about the organization, the products, the market and, not least, the company's culture. <br><br>Search the web for relevant articles / posts about the company, market, competitors, etc. Check out the profile of the manager on LinkedIn and the company profile on Twitter, Facebook or other social media. All this gives you an insight in which size the company have, and can also help you to prepare relevant questions.
            <br><br>
            <b>Here are a few questions for inspiration:</b>
            <ul class="p">
                <li class="p">What distinguishes the employees who are successful in the company?</li>
                <li class="p">How do your employees describe you as a manager? </li>
                <li class="p">What should a new employee do in order for you to be pleasantly surprised?</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Yourself:</b>
            <ul class="p">
                <p>Consider answers to questions you can expect to be asked, such as</p>
                <li class="p">Your strengths and weaknesses (of some development areas)?</li>
                <li class="p">Your motivation to apply for this job?</li>
                <li class="p">What success are you most proud of?</li>
                <li class="p">What error did you learn most?</li>
                <li class="p">What is the most important thing for you the first 3 months and the first year of work?</li>
                <li class="p">Which job / area of responsibility would you like to work in 3-5 years?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Know your reaction and nervousness so you can prepare yourself and react appropriately. It is quite understandable to be nervous in a job interview; It's an important event. So do not worry that you may get hot and red with just nervousness - it does not pull down as long as you maintain the overview and the calm. An aid could be to compile a keyword script so you have something to stick to. You can also train the conversation with a friend who can act as "the devil's lawyer" or you can practice in front of a mirror.<br><br> But be prepared to improvise. The conversation can take another turn - it's not your agenda! Show who you are as a person - be honest. It is as important to you as to the company that there is a match between you and the position, otherwise you will not enjoy it.<br><br> In Nordisk Film, we sometimes experience applicants who are less interested in the job themselves and more and more just want a foot inside. It does not work. It is first and foremost the available job that you are looking for.<br><br>
                <b>On the day of the interview</b><br><br> Arrive before the interview so you can get the pulse down before you go in. Do not come too early, 5-10 min. before is appropriate.<br><br> Dress appropriately in relation to the company. The company's website can give you a hint on how to dress the place. If not, a good guide: Not too nice and not too relaxed. Be sure to ask for the necessary and relevant information so that you get a real decision base.<br><br> Remember that the conversation is an equal dialogue whose purpose is to find the best match between job and person - in the company and in your interest.
